# SStore

A high-level distributed file system written in Java.

This experimental project is built for the following tasks:

1. Provide fully transparent data encryption to client programs.

2. Provide fine-grained authentication and access control of client programs.

3. Support flexible consistency levels for data replicas.

4. Support a fine-grained hybrid of replication and erasure coding.

5. Design in-memory structure to optimize services like encryptoin and consistency.
